# Pill-Papa
This game was created for the ChargerHacks 2023 hackathon. In the game, you play as the pharmacist using the Pill Papa app. You receive the symptoms of a patient and the app will display the corresponding medicine they need. You then click on the correct medicine on the shelf and repeat this process for 4 other patients. However,  if you click on the wrong medicine you lose the game.
